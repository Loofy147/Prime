# Phase 3 Best Practices Guide: Scalability and Enterprise-Readiness

This guide provides a set of best practices to follow when implementing Phase 3 of the AI Prime roadmap.

## 3.1. Implement Advanced MLOps Practices

*   **Data as Code:** Treat your data as code. Use a data versioning system to track changes to your datasets, and use a CI/CD pipeline to automate the process of building and testing your datasets.
*   **Model as Code:** Treat your models as code. Use a model registry to track and manage your models, and use a CI/CD pipeline to automate the process of training, evaluating, and deploying your models.
*   **Continuous Monitoring:** Continuously monitor your models in production. This will help you to detect and diagnose problems early.

## 3.2. Enhance Scalability and Resilience

*   **Stateless Services:** Design your services to be stateless. This will make it easier to scale them horizontally.
*   **Graceful Degradation:** Implement graceful degradation to ensure that your system can handle failures gracefully.
*   **Chaos Engineering:** Use chaos engineering to test the resilience of your system.

## 3.3. Enterprise-Grade Features

*   **NIST RBAC:** Use the NIST RBAC model as a starting point for your RBAC system. The NIST RBAC model is a well-defined and widely accepted standard.
*   **Immutable Audit Logs:** Make your audit logs immutable. This will prevent them from being tampered with.
*   **Clear SLA:** Clearly define your SLA and the associated penalties. This will give your customers confidence in your service.
